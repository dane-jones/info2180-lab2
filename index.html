                    From her first video, 2012’s mesmerizing “Hide,” the singular focus of her vision was apparent, a holistic project 
                    that rendered FKA twigs’ operatic approach to club beats inextricable from her astounding art direction. In the seven 
                    years since, she has made her art into a kind of theatrical multimedia experience, crafting elaborate shows and videos 
                    that intertwine and smudge the lines of classicism and the avant-garde. She is astonishing, ambitious, and seemingly 
                    good at everything, singing over her own ticker-tape beats, self-directing wildly conceptual videos, and ravenously hoovering 
                    up dance disciplines (apparently up to and including Chinese sword fighting) until she masters them.

                    By locating herself in Magdalene’s lineage, twigs, a Catholic school alumnus, explores the ways deeply conservative expectations 
                    trammel women; in doing so, she locates a version of herself within these ancient and oppressive archetypes, upending and transcending 
                    them through the power of her songwriting and the sheer magnetic pull of her presence. The 10 Best Dream Pop Albums
                    “thousand eyes” opens MAGDALENE with twigs singing in the austere polyphony of Medieval church music, a meditation on the moment before 
                    a permanent departure (“If I walk out the door it starts our last goodbye”) that, with repetition, reveals itself as a hymn. 
                    It’s a prologue for an album whose songs are produced like narratives, with a beginning, climax, and denouement. She grapples with survival—psychic 
                    and physical survival—the way a woman who lives to move might respond to being laid out by tumors on an organ that facilitates birth.

                <h2>A Little Life Review *saddest book ever*</h2>
                <p id="bh">March 24, 2015 by Emily May</p>

                    The title of the most dismal novel I've ever read would likely go to A Little Life. I'm not even exaggerating, I swear.
                    I'm not sure if this is a favorable or negative review at this time. Despite the fact that this book is without a doubt 
                    beautifully written and contains some of the most raw and honest prose I've ever had the pleasure or misfortune of reading, 
                    it's a very long character study with over 700 pages of misery, drug abuse, self-harm, sexual and psychological abuse 
                    (and its aftereffects), and very little of the "light" promised in the blurb. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    This book contains a section titled "The Happy Years," which, in my opinion, is the most misleading title I've ever seen. 
                    However, let me first give you a general notion of what this book is about. The story begins with four young friends who are destitute 
                    and unsure of themselves traveling to New York and attempting to find their path. To put it simply, the portrayal of JB, Malcolm, Willem, and Jude is fantastic. They are such intricately constructed people, with unique passions, aspirations, and anxieties.
                    Jude finds himself at the center of this story, impacting the lives of his three pals, even though the book chronicles the lives of all four of them.
